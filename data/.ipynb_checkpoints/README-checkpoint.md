# Data

## Lineages

### `bhatla-lineage.json`

This dataset was generated by evaluating the JavaScript object provided [here](http://wormweb.org/js/json-celllineage.js) and copying to JSON. This can be most easily done by pasting the data into a browser JS console:

```js
copy(JSON.stringify(...));
```

Or by calling the `getJson()` function on [this page](http://wormweb.org/celllineage):

```js
copy(JSON.stringify(getJson()))
```
